                    <h3>
                        As part of the famous state of California, the city of San Francisco has a bold American imprint with its hippie culture and cutting-edge technological revolutions. Compared to familiar destinations such as New York or the capital Washington, D.C., San Francisco is younger and "cooler". Americans still say "If you haven't traveled to San Francisco, you haven't been to America". The best time to pack up your stuff to explore this dynamic city is from June to August yearly, when the weather in San Francisco is sunny, it is suitable for visitors to set foot on the Golden Gate Bridge and reach the American dream.
